To Host on Adaptable:
-use Node.js

1) npm install serve

2) change scripts: 

from: 

"scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start",

  },

to: 

"scripts": {
"dev": "react-scripts start",
"start": "serve -s build -l $PORT",

}


3) 
Save that file. Now, we need to tell Adaptable to build your client as part of the deploy process.
So go to Adaptable and on your App Status page, click the Settings tab. Then click Node.js Settings.
In the Build Scripts box, type: build

Then click "Save Settings". (Don't update the deployment yet.)

(To Run locally now, you have to enter "npm run dev")
