To Host on Adaptable:

1) npm install serve

2) change scripts: 

from: 

"scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "build": "react-scripts build",
    "test": "react-scripts test",
    "eject": "react-scripts eject"
  },

to: 

"scripts": {
"dev": "react-scripts --opensl-legacy-provider start",
"start": "serve -s build -l $PORT",
"build": "react-scripts build",
"test": "react-scripts test",
"eject": "react-scripts eject"
}


3) 
Save that file. Now, we need to tell Adaptable to build your client as part of the deploy process.
So go to Adaptable and on your App Status page, click the Settings tab. Then click Node.js Settings.
In the Build Scripts box, type: build

Then click "Save Settings". (Don't update the deployment yet.)
